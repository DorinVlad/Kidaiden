        <br>
        <p>This Privacy Policy governs the Kidaiden website (the "Site"), mobile site, application and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, transmitted, published or broadcast (each, a "Service" and collectively, the "Services"), provided by
          Kidaiden LLC, its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates (“we“, “us” or “our”) that links to this Privacy Policy, which is binding on all those who access, visit and/or use the Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We provide this
          Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the
          Services, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content offered through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new

          <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain information that could reasonably be used to contact you or identify you personally ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your
              name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and mailing address. Personal Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) that is associated, on a persistent or on-going
              basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) you use to access the Services.</li>
            <li>Some features on the Services may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable, such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender (such demographic information is referred to collectively, along with
              Usage Information (defined below), as “Non-Personal Information”). We may use Non-Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Services. Non-Personal Information is generally non-identifying, but, if
              we associate it with you as an identifiable individual, we will treat it as Personal Information.
            </li>
            <li>When visitors use our Services, we and our third-party service providers also may automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system you are using (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS),
              the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of the Internet service provider you are using your activity while using our Services (e.g., which of our pages you have viewed, the content viewed, and the
              advertisements you have been shown) (“Usage Information”). When you download a content player on one of our Services (a “Player”), we may record that a download took place. When you launch a Player, our servers may automatically record that
              information. When the Player checks for new updates, it may also automatically send the version number and operating system information to our servers. We collect this information for the purposes set forth below in How We Use the Information We
              Collect.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that when you register to become a Kidaiden member or member of any of our other Services (each, a “Member”), other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that
              you post or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.

          <h3>Collection Methods/Cookies/Tracking Technologies</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Our Services may use software technology such as "cookies," “flash cookies,” "web beacons," “embedded scripts,” or other similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies"). These Tracking Technologies are used to help
              tailor our content, allow visitors to move between associated websites without logging into each site, and other purposes related to our management of the Services. Cookies are small text files stored locally on your Device that help store user
              preferences. You can learn more about cookies at
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>
              and
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Web beacons or "clear gifs" are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views
              or advertising responses. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web
              server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. We may use Tracking Technologies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various
              sections of our Services and to improve or customize the content, offerings and advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience through our Services, such as to recognize you by your user name and when
              you return to our Services, and save your password and password-protective areas.
            </li>
            <li>We, our third-party service providers and/or partners may also use Tracking Technologies, such as cookies, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Services. Moreover, we, our third-party
              service providers and/or our partners may use Tracking Technologies to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.
            </li>
            <li>In addition to the Tracking Technologies, data collected on our web servers supply us with aggregate Usage Information about the number of visits to different pages on our Services. We use such aggregate Usage Information to improve access to
              content based on our visitor's browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many users as possible.
            </li>
